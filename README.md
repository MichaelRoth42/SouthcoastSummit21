# SouthcoastSummit21
**Tl;dr - Recommendated learning material for the PL-200 certification**


The Southcoast Summit 2021 was two weeks ago and Malin Martnes and I delivered a session about what you need to know before taking the Microsoft PL-200 exam. During our session we gave a lot of recommendations of who to follow, what blogs to read and what videos might be helpful. 

Here we are with a neatly ordered list of awesome people who deliver valuable resource to learn and thrive. 

If you attended our session or know somebody who might be interested in a collection of useful resources to boost your Power Platform knowledge, please share, retweet, comment and spread the word. 

Please remember that one of the most important tips is to talk to people. The whole community is there to help you. If you think your questions are stupid and not worthy to ask, just remember two things:

1.	They are not, there are no stupid questions
2.	If there are stupid questions, I already asked them. Believe me, I ask ALL the obvious stuff over and over again. If you think you have a stupid question, there was always somebody who asked it before.
